VOTING DAPP
I developed a decentralized voting application using blockchain technology to facilitate secure and transparent leader elections. The application ensures a safe and secure connection through blockchain principles.

Key Features:

Blockchain Integration: Utilized Ethereum blockchain to guarantee the integrity and immutability of votes.
Smart Contracts: Deployed smart contracts to manage voting logic and ensure compliance with election rules.
Ganache: Used Ganache to create a local Ethereum blockchain environment for development and testing. Successfully imported multiple accounts, each with 100 ETH for testing purposes.
MetaMask: Integrated MetaMask for user interactions, allowing users to cast votes securely from their accounts.
Voting Mechanism: Implemented functionality to allow only one vote per account, ensuring fairness in the election process.
This app exemplifies the use of blockchain for secure and transparent voting systems, showcasing a practical application of blockchain technology in real-world scenarios.
